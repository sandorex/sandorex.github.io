Note the story is written trough foggy memories and I am by no means a writer, this is thrown together as best as I could

I've begun my coding journey pretty early at age of 11, when I say coding it was mostly copy pasting VB from YouTube videos that were recorded using *Unregistered HyperCam 2* and typing into a notepad with [same song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WPCLda_erI) playing in the background..
At the time I did not have any knowledge of English whatsoever, so I did not get any of it, but the sheer joy I felt at the moment a progress bar moved is indescribable!

After a progress bar became boring for me I've found a game that changed my life, I am not kidding, it was an MMORPG called [Runes Of Magic](https://gameforge.com/en-US/play/runes_of_magic), I learned English by playing it! (I picked an US server cause I did not know what it meant)

Another important part that motivated me was *Wild Ones*, a 2D platformer on Facebook that I loved  
There were few paid characters like a bat and a platypus, so I wanted one and I've found one of those scam YouTube [cheat engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) tutorials to "hack" the game and get the paid characters  
The hack goes like this, you slow down the game using cheat engine and quickly change from a regular character to the paid character you wanted and buy it  
This exploit works, but there was a caveat, you get banned after reloading the page, of course I did not know this at the time, so I was ecstatic and immediately did it for my brother too (we both got banned)  
Even though we got banned I still tried using cheat engine, everywhere after that, I was so amazed how it changed the values and the mysterious code that start with `0x` so I tried learning C++ (smart right?) and that did not go well, was it my low understanding of programming, low level of English language or both I do not know, but I do know that I gave up for a while

Later on came [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/) that we all know, I loved it, it was like playing with unlimited legos!  
But there was also modding using [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)  
Oh, what a joy it was, while my English was rusty for sure it did not stop me from watching YouTube tutorials for Minecraft modding (there were very few of them though), that got me into *Java* my first programming language  
I've made a couple of mods that did nothing special but add weird blocks but the feeling was there!

After a while I wanted to learn other languages, to see what they look like and the next one was C#, it was amazing cause the Java GUI stuff looked awful  
So I started making some stupid little apps for the fun, until a few years later that I got to C++, I resolved myself to learn it so that I could make my own cheats (yeah, I thought hackers were so cool back then) for games, it did get me into learning C++ for real and it was hard, but refreshingly different from Java or C#, I did not like Visual Studio cause my computer wasn't fast at all so I used [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) and many others my favorite back then was [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)

Learning C++ took a few years, im no master but it's the language I used the most and I know the best
