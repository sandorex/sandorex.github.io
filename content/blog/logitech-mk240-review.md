> **NOTE** i will update this (If i remember) after some period has passed

## Prelude
I've been using Redragon K552-BA for a while (really loud ~1.5 yrs) and then key chattering started appearing and they repaired it once and returned it with the same problem, then 30 days after i've sent it for repair the second time they refunded me the money i paid for it back then (50e, which i am glad for, bought the [Xiaomi Wowstick F1+](https://www.banggood.com/Wowstick-1F+-64-In-1-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Lithium-ion-Charge-LED-Power-Screwdriver-From-XIAOMI-ECO-System-p-1294707.html?utmid=14962&utm_design=107&utm_source=webpush&utm_medium=Mail_webpush184_pc&utm_campaign=newsletterwebpush&utm_content=elaine&cs=new02&cur_warehouse=CN) heh)

So i've set out to hunt a new small keyboard as my old one is some giant relic Saitek one which has 2 key rollover which is annoying even for typing as this wireless one does it better with 5 key rollover, but i digress..

I've been searching for a while and it was crucial for it to be small so i have more free space on my desk
The problem is all small keyboards are either expensive or really old designs on market here

My budget wasn't high and all mechanical ones are really expensive here (and amazon isn't worth the 100e shipping) otherwise i would just get a 40% keyboard

After searching for days and days i've only found two keyboards that are small, [Genius LUXEMATE 100](https://www.newegg.com/genius-luxemate-100-31300725100-see-details/p/N82E16823102074) and well the Logitech MK240

I've bought it (for 30e) thinking if it sucked ill just return it, it took a while to come with some kind of logistic error in the company

## First Impressions
The keys feel weird, kinda mushy, the layout is awesome, i've got pretty fast on it in 10 minutes!

Mouse is crappy but good enough, the wheel is awful though it sometimes scrolls without moving even a single step

The keyboard is pretty small so desk space usage is minimal
I've never used a wireless keyboard before and i was scared about the delay but it works great and has 5 key rollover

## Layout
Layout is great, except the Fn key which i repeatedly press instead of Windows key...

Home, PgUp, PgDown, End are mapped to Fn key and Left, Up, Down, Right respectively, i've been using it while in shell or programming and its quite convinient

The media keys are of course using Fn and F1 - F12 keys which to be honest i don't mind

## USB Noise
The keyboard can act erratically if plugged in an USB that has a lot of noise, while i have not measured it myself i know my pc is quite noisy and old (with a cheap ass powersupply that's been working for 5 years), it lagged A LOT in the front panel USBs but plugging it in my monitor's USB hub (it's a 3.0 but i used a 2.0 extender cable so i think that does not matter) and it's working wonderfully!

**Be aware that you may or may not have problems depending on your setup**

## Possible Annoyances
- There is no indication of caps lock, which i don't use anyways but just in case you should know about that

- The mouse wheel is awful as i've said already (i've found a remedy that makes it less awful, look into fixes section below)

- I have not been using it long enough to test the batteries (they are included in the box) but there is 2 AAA batteries in both the keyboard and the mouse

- Mouse automatically turns off after a while of standby and may lag at first movement or click when waking up, while i don't really mind this it may be annoying for someone

- Keyboard does not have an on/off switch (the mouse does) so you cannot turn it off without taking out the batteries, this kinda annoyed me because i accidentally pressed keys quite often

- Mouse is clicky and so is the keyboard, the keyboard is not that bad as in to wake someone up but don't expect silence

- The batteries are pretty crappy and the mouse uses ton of power so batteries wont last more than few months except if you barely use it at all

## Mouse Fixes (written on Feb 2 2021, few months of use)
- The wheel may not work properly if dirt gets in the wheel and obstruct the sensor, so either blow on it or use compressed air, opening it is optional but recommended (not that hard one screw below the batteries and clamps all around)

- The wheel is pressed by a metal spring from the left side which means if you apply pressure to the right while rotating it may skip more, the spring was pretty loose on mine and i've pressed in into the wheel more after opening it up

- The upper plastic from which the left and right buttons are cut out is loose and can be moved, (*this may or may not have been from my professional opening of the device*) it makes the clicks miss sometimes and require more pressure also sometimes obstructs the wheel from rotating by pressing into it, i've fixed it by spewing hot glue over the clamps that hold the upper plastic together with the middle piece

## Conclusion
Overall the combo is great, i've been loving it for 30 days now and it has been working wonderfully, and i've learned it's even spillproof!
